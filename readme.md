# Heroku Deployment
## Deploy by building it on Heroku's server
You need Heroku CLI

1. Clone this repo
2. Create an app on Heroku
3. Set git remote to Heroku `heroku git:remote -a  your-app-name`
4. Set stack to container `heroku stack:set container -a your-app-name`

## Deploy by building it on your computer
You need Heroku CLI & Docker

1. Clone this repo
2. Create an app on Heroku
3. Build the image and push to Container Registry `heroku container:push web -a your-app-name`
4. Release the image `heroku container:release web`

## ngram support

The program will automatically download ngram while the app is running. (see misc/start.sh)
Depending on the speed of Heroku & LanguageTool's server, ngram will take a while.
As Heroku file system is ephemeral, once the app is restarted, the ngram will be deleted and need to download again on next start.
